# Exceptions

Exceptions are issues that Turbine thinks are worth further attention. Exceptions can be operational (a late order that hasn't shipped), financial (an invoice that doesn't match what was ordered), or data-related (a SKU that doesn't exist in Turbine yet).

We surface exceptions via the Exceptions page, which captures all types of exceptions in one place.
