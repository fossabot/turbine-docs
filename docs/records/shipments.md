# Shipments
Shipments are the movement of items between vendors, nodes, and your customers.

For inbound shipments, we link purchase orders with incoming deliveries. Sometimes POs get spread out over multiple shipments, or multiple POs are included in one shipment. This makes it difficult to determine when a purchase order has been fulfilled. With Turbine, you can keep track of what you have on hand and what's on the way. We also integrate with carriers such as UPS, C.H. Robinson, and others.
