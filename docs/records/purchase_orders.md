# Purchase Orders
Purchase orders, also referred to as POs, are the first part of the three-way match.

We help you cut purchase orders and link created POs to receipts, invoices, and freight shipments. We also calculate the landed COGS of each purchase order, so you don't have to rely on outdated models. 

If a discrepancy occurs, we'll raise an [exception](/exceptions/three-way-match) so any issues can be identified and dealt with quickly.
