# Incoterms

An Incoterm, short for International Commercial Terms, is a set of standardized trade terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that are commonly used in international commercial transactions. These terms define the responsibilities, risks, and costs associated with the transportation and delivery of goods between buyers and sellers.

Key aspects covered by Incoterms include:

* **Delivery Point**: Indicates where the seller's responsibility for the goods ends and where the buyer's responsibility begins.
* **Transportation Costs**: Determines which party is responsible for covering transportation costs, insurance, and any other expenses related to the shipment.
* * **Risk Transfer**: Specifies when the risk of loss or damage to the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer.
