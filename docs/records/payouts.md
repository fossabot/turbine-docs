# Payouts

Payouts are transactions that debit a tenantâ€™s account on a payment provider and credit their bank account. A payout typically includes funds from many payments, depending on the cadence selected by the tenant. A payout represents the last step in the order-to-cash process.

Most payment providers pay customers out through Shopify Payments. Only Amazon Pay, PayPal, and Affirm pay tenants out through their own platforms. (source: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/getting-paid#how-you-get-paid)

Payouts typically occur on a set schedule (it looks like Shopify's default is daily, thought they allow users to schedule payouts as well).
