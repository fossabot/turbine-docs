# Receipts
Receipts are the second part of the three-way match reconciliation process. 

After a [purchase order](/records/purchase_orders) has been completed and the goods have been delivered to their destination, a receipt is provided by the vendor. 

Ideally, the items and quantities listed should be exactly the same as the purchase order. Sometimes, the production levels are off. Error tolerance levels are usually +/- 5% of what was originally ordered. 

In the event an error is greater than what you specify, we'll raise an [exception](/exceptions/three-way-match) so you can figure out what went wrong.
