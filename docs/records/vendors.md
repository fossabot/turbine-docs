# Vendors

In Turbine, vendors or suppliers are critical entities that supply goods or services to businesses. They are registered on the platform with detailed information including their legal and "Doing Business As" (DBA) names, which help in distinguishing and authenticating various vendors. Additionally, Turbine collects contact details of individuals handling operations and Purchase Orders (POs), facilitating seamless communication and transaction management.

To streamline inventory management and avoid discrepancies, Turbine allows you to map your internal SKUs and components to the respective Vendor SKUs. This ensures a unified system where products are identified uniformly, irrespective of the varied nomenclatures used by different vendors. This not only helps in maintaining a structured database but also aids in efficient procurement processes, fostering a harmonious business relationship between companies and their vendors or suppliers.
