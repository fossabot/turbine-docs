# Quickbooks
Our QuickBooks integration allows you to ensure your accounting reflects your inventory status.

For example, when you cut a purchase order, our integration creates the journal entry that moves money to accounts payable.  

To set up the integration, provision a user to the Turbine email address your account manager shares with you. Thatâ€™s it!

Turbine will not make historical changes pre-dating the integration. If you have other needs, speak with your account manager directly.

Invoices created in QuickBooks will not be synced to Turbine.
