# Quickbooks
Our QuickBooks integration allows you to continue to use the platform to create invoices, and see the data in Turbine. 

To set up the integration, provision a user to the Turbine email address your account manager shares with you. Thatâ€™s it!

Turbine will gather all historical information on invoices and vendors, and capture invoices going forward.

Invoices created in QuickBooks will not be synced to Turbine.
